This guide explains how to use the payload information for a machine learning task.

Model Identification
--------------------

Use the `mid` field to identify the model that will be trained. This is a unique identifier for each model.

API Endpoint
------------

The `url` field is the API endpoint where the model training or prediction request will be sent. This is where you send your POST request for training or prediction.

Data Sources
------------

The `file_paths` field contains the paths to the CSV files that will be used for training or prediction. Make sure these files are accessible and have the correct format.

Features and Target Variables
-----------------------------

The `x` and `y` fields describe the structure of the input and output data. Each key-value pair in `x` represents a feature, and in `y` represents a target variable. The type ("NUMBER" or "CATEGORY") indicates whether the variable is numerical or categorical.

Payload Type
------------

The `type` field is used by the system to determine how to process the payload. In this case, "structure" means that the payload describes the structure of the data and the model.

Example
-------

Here's an example of a payload using a dummy mixed mode data source:

.. code-block:: json

  {
    "mid": "model123",
    "url": "https://api.virtuousai.com/train",
    "file_paths": [
      "/path/to/dummy_data1.csv",
      "/path/to/dummy_data2.csv"
    ],
    "x": {
      "age": "NUMBER",
      "job": "CATEGORY",
      "marital_status": "CATEGORY",
      "education": "CATEGORY",
      "default": "CATEGORY",
      "balance": "NUMBER",
      "housing": "CATEGORY",
      "loan": "CATEGORY",
      "contact": "CATEGORY",
      "day": "NUMBER",
      "month": "CATEGORY",
      "duration": "NUMBER",
      "campaign": "NUMBER",
      "pdays": "NUMBER",
      "previous": "NUMBER",
      "poutcome": "CATEGORY"
    },
    "y": {
      "deposit": "CATEGORY"
    },
    "type": "structure"
  }

This payload would be used to train a model identified by `mid` on the data in the specified CSV files, using the API endpoint specified in the `url` field. The model would predict the `deposit` field based on the input features specified in the `x` field.

Please note that this is a dummy example and the actual usage might depend on the specific application or library that uses this payload. Always refer to the relevant documentation for specific instructions.
