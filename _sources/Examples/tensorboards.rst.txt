Visualize Train and Test Results
==============================================================

This tutorial will guide you through the process of using TensorBoard, a suite of visualization tools provided by TensorFlow, with PyTorch.

Install Necessary Libraries
---------------------------

First, you need to install PyTorch and TensorBoard. You can do this using pip:

.. code-block:: bash

   pip install torch torchvision torchaudio tensorboard

Import Libraries and Prepare Data
---------------------------------

Next, import the necessary libraries and prepare your data for training.

.. code-block:: python

   import torch
   import torchvision
   from torch.utils.tensorboard import SummaryWriter
   from torchvision import datasets, transforms

   # Transform the data
   transform = transforms.Compose([transforms.ToTensor(), transforms.Normalize((0.5,), (0.5,))])

   # Download and load the training data
   trainset = datasets.MNIST('~/.pytorch/MNIST_data/', download=True, train=True, transform=transform)
   trainloader = torch.utils.data.DataLoader(trainset, batch_size=64, shuffle=True)

Define Your Model
-----------------

Define your model using PyTorch. Here's an example of a simple feedforward network:

.. code-block:: python

   from torch import nn

   # Define the network architecture
   model = nn.Sequential(nn.Linear(784, 128),
                         nn.ReLU(),
                         nn.Linear(128, 64),
                         nn.ReLU(),
                         nn.Linear(64, 10),
                         nn.LogSoftmax(dim=1))

Train Your Model and Log Data
-----------------------------

Train your model and log necessary data for visualization. This typically includes loss and accuracy.

.. code-block:: python

   from torch import optim

   # Define the loss and optimizer
   criterion = nn.NLLLoss()
   optimizer = optim.SGD(model.parameters(), lr=0.003)

   # Create a SummaryWriter
   writer = SummaryWriter()

   dataiter = iter(trainloader)
   images, labels = dataiter.next()

   # Train the network
   for epoch in range(5):
       running_loss = 0
       for images, labels in trainloader:
           # Flatten images into a 784 long vector
           images = images.view(images.shape[0], -1)
       
           # Training pass
           optimizer.zero_grad()
           
           output = model(images)
           loss = criterion(output, labels)
           
           # Backward pass
           loss.backward()
           
           # Optimize the weights
           optimizer.step()
           
           running_loss += loss.item()
       else:
           print(f"Training loss: {running_loss/len(trainloader)}")
           
       # Add scalar data to TensorBoard
       writer.add_scalar("Loss/train", running_loss, epoch)

   # Close the SummaryWriter
   writer.close()

Start TensorBoard
-----------------

Once you have logged data from your model training, you can start TensorBoard:

.. code-block:: bash

   tensorboard --logdir=runs

Now you can access TensorBoard at `localhost:6006` in your web browser.

That's it! You've now used TensorBoard with PyTorch for visualizing your model's performance. Please note that this is a basic tutorial and the exact steps may vary depending on your specific setup and requirements. Always ensure to follow best practices and guidelines when configuring your system.
